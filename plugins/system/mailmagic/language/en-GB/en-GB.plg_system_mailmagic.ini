PLG_SYSTEM_MAILMAGIC_LBL_TESTEMAIL_SUBJECT="Demonstration email from MailMagic"
PLG_SYSTEM_MAILMAGIC_LBL_TESTEMAIL_BODY="Hello, %s\n\nThis is MailMagic, running on your site, %s.\n\nIf you have already enabled the MailMagic plugin this email, which started its life as a plain text email, will have been sent to you as a full HTML email. If it's still plain text please check you've actually published the MailMagic plugin and SAVED the changes in Joomla's plugin manager. If this still doesn't help check third party extensions. One of them is erroneously overriding the JMail class instead of the Joomla\CMS\Mail\Mail class, i.e. it's incompatible with Joomla version 3.8 and later.\n\nHave a great day!"
